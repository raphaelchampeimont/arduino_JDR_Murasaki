Arduino mini-project: rolling dice with motion detector

A small Arduino project that I made for rolling dice for a tabletop RPG, with digital display using base 5 with custom characters (with digits I invented for the tabletop RPG).

The counter on top right is just a clock, again with the custom base 5 display.

There are japanese characters on the left (the world "dice" is written in japanese) in katakana that are natively supported by the display (although other non-ASCII characters are not) because this LCD screen follows a japanese standard created by Hitachi (HD44780U).
